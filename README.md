This is an Analog Clock.

HTML Head:

The page is defined in HTML5, with the UTF-8 character encoding and a viewport meta tag to ensure the page is responsive across different devices.
The page title is set to "Analog Clock".
The page links to an external CSS file (index.css) for styling and an external JavaScript file (index.js) for functionality.

Body:
The body contains a div with the ID "clockContainer" which holds the content of the clock.
Inside this container, there is an image element that displays a random nature image fetched from Picsum (used as a background or visual element).
There are three other div elements with IDs "hour", "minute", and "second", which are placeholders for the clock's hour, minute, and second hands.

CSS:

This CSS is primarily responsible for the visual appearance of an analog clock. The clock container holds the background image (likely a clock face), and the hands (hour, minute, second) are absolutely positioned and styled to rotate around their bottom edge. The styling ensures the clock is responsive to different screen sizes, with the hands of the clock positioned proportionally within the container. The second hand has a subtle red color applied through the .h-r class. The clock's background image is set to scale properly and has a semi-transparent effect.

JavaScript:

in Js only have the math and calculation portion

For Hours - 30*htime + mtime/2;

For Minutes - 6*mtime;

For seconds - 6*stime;
